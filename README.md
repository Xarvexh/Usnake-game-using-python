 You’ve probably played, or at least seen, the game of Snake before. The player  controls a snake by pressing the arrow keys, and the snake has to maneuver around the  screen, eating apples. With each apple eaten, the tail’s snake grows one unit. The goal is to  eat as many apples as possible without running into a wall or the snake’s ever-increasing tail. 
If, or rather when, the snake bumps into the edge of the screen or accidentally eats  himself the game is over. The more apples the snake eats the higher the score. 

The problem statement is to design a Snake Game which provides the following functionalities: • Snake can move in a given direction and when it eats the food, the length of snake  increases.  
• When snake crosses itself, the game will over.  
• Food will be generated at given interval. 
The main classes that can be used are:
